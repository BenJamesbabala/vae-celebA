To run the code, you need to use Tensorflow and Tensorlayer([how to install tensorlayer?](https://github.com/zsdonghao/tensorlayer)).
## SOME NOTES
This is the code for the paper
**[Deep Feature Consistent Variational Autoencoder](https://houxianxu.github.io/assets/project/dfcvae)**  
In loss function we used a vgg loss.Check this [how to load and use a pretrained VGG-16?](https://github.com/zsdonghao/tensorlayer/blob/master/example/tutorial_vgg16.py)if you have trouble reading vgg_loss.py.  

## future work
I'm currently busy with graduation project.An tutorial with more details on this model will be released in two months.
